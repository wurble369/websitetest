# Application Programming Interface (API) #

A key aspect of the NHS e-RS vision is to enable local innovation and adoption of paperless referrals. You can do this in a secure and controlled manner using our API. The APIs are a well-defined interface aiding new software solutions in a simple way.

We want to stimulate and assist your development of applications linked to the NHS e-RS via its API. We describe and provide the usual tasks and support documents you will need here.
